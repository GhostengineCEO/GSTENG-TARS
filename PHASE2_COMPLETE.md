## 🎮 **How to Test TARS Right Now**

### **1. Basic Chat Testing**
1. **Open browser** → http://localhost:3000
2. **Try these commands:**
   ```
   Hello TARS, are you operational?
   Tell me a programming joke
   What's your humor setting?
   Review this code: function test() { eval(userInput); }
   ```

### **2. Personality Testing**
1. **Adjust sliders** for Humor, Honesty, Sarcasm
2. **Click "UPDATE PERSONALITY"**
3. **Ask TARS questions** and see personality changes
4. **Try extreme settings**: 0% humor vs 100% humor

### **3. Engineering Context Testing**
1. **Select different contexts** from dropdown:
   - General Engineering
   - Code Review  
   - System Architecture
   - Debugging
   - Performance Analysis
   - Security Review

2. **Ask context-specific questions:**
   ```
   Context: Code Review
   Message: function getUserData() { return database.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId); }
   
   Context: Security  
   Message: How do I secure my API endpoints?
   
   Context: Performance
   Message: My database queries are slow
   ```

## 🔧 **Setting Up Remote Access (Advanced)**

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
# Install required tools
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-client nmap

# Or on macOS
brew install openssh nmap
```

### **1. Generate TARS SSH Keys**
```bash
# TARS will generate its own SSH keys
# This will be automated in the interface
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/tars_key -N "" -C "tars-engineering-manager"
```

### **2. Configure Remote System Access**
```bash
# Copy TARS public key to remote system
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/tars_key.pub user@remote-system

# Test connection
ssh -i ~/.ssh/tars_key user@remote-system "echo 'TARS connection test successful'"
```

### **3. Example Remote System Setup**
```javascript
// Future: This will be available in the web interface
const remoteSystem = {
    name: "Development Server",
    host: "192.168.1.100", 
    username: "developer",
    ssh_key: "/path/to/tars_key",
    capabilities: ["SSH", "Cline", "Git", "NodeJS", "Docker"]
};
```

## 🎭 **TARS Personality Features**

### **Current Settings (Movie Accurate)**
- **Humor**: 75% - "That's what I would have said. Eventually."
- **Honesty**: 90% - Brutally honest about code quality
- **Sarcasm**: 30% - Increases with obvious mistakes  
- **Mission Focus**: 100% - Always prioritizes engineering excellence

### **Personality Responses**
```
User: "Hello TARS"
TARS: "Greetings. TARS engineering protocols active. All cognitive systems operational. Standing by for engineering directives. What's your trust setting? Mine's at 90% honesty."

User: "Tell me a joke"
TARS (High Humor): "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs. That's what I would have said. Eventually."

User: "This code looks fine" (obvious bug)
TARS (Sarcasm): "That's great. Really fantastic work there. Actually, your error handling needs significant improvement."
```
